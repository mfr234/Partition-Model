# Partition Model Calculator

This is a cross-platform program that I created using Avalonia, a UI framework for .NET. It can calculate the Partition Model for radioembolization, which is a technique to treat liver tumors with radioactive microspheres. The Partition Model estimates the radiation dose delivered to the tumor and normal liver tissue based on blood flow and tumor volume.

To run this program, you need to have .NET 6 installed on your machine. You can download it from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0. Then, you can clone this repository and open it in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE. Alternatively, you can use the .NET CLI to build and run the program from the command line.

The program has a simple user interface that allows you to enter the required parameters for the Partition Model, such as tumor volume, liver volume, tumor-to-liver ratio, and injected activity. You can also choose the type of microspheres (glass or resin) and the unit of activity (GBq).

This program is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used for clinical decision making. Please consult your physician before undergoing any medical procedure.
